# FR-201: Canonical identity domain vocabulary

## Description

When a digest is compared to another digest, the reader SHALL compare the
selected identity domain before the bytes, so that an identity derived under one
domain is unequal to an identity derived under another regardless of byte
equality.

## Values

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ir-canonical` | Existing contract-IR canonical identity. Retains its original bare-hex syntax and algorithm; it does not adopt the JCS prefix or canonicalization (FR-018-AC-6). |
| `ir-bound` | Existing contract-IR bound identity. Held distinct from `ir-canonical` by FR-015. |
| `ir-semantic` | IR semantic digest. Includes its prescribed domain separation (FR-015-AC-2). |
| `filament-fingerprint` | Filament fingerprint. Held distinct from contract-IR identities and from raw artifact digests by FR-015. |
| `package-fingerprint` | Package fingerprint. A lock-file digest cannot substitute for it (FR-015-AC-3). |
| `lock-file-digest` | Lock-file digest. Cannot substitute for `package-fingerprint` (FR-015-AC-3). |
| `raw-artifact-digest` | Raw artifact digest. Hashes the complete supplied bytes, including layout (FR-018). |
| `filament.export/v1` | Exact canonical Filament producer export domain; distinct from the producer's own `filament-fingerprint` identifier. |
| `quire.package.semantic/v1` | Checked semantic-package graph domain; distinct from package archive and lock-file bytes. |
| `quire.diagnostic-catalog.bytes/v1` | Exact diagnostic-catalog source bytes, including layout. |
| `quire.generated-artifact.bytes/v1` | Exact generated artifact bytes under its selected artifact kind/profile. |
| `quire.tool-manifest.jcs/v1` | RFC 8785 canonical tool/plugin/provider manifest bytes. |
| `typed-expression-identity` | Source-free typed-expression identity. Requires a typed derivation; an unlinked syntax tree cannot claim it, and current native syntax has no qualified canonical semantic identity (FR-015, FR-015-AC-4). |
| `quire.verification.jcs` | Verification JCS domain, `version: rfc8785-v1`, `algorithm: sha256`. Emitted as `sha256-jcs:` followed by 64 lowercase hexadecimal digits over RFC 8785 canonical UTF-8 bytes (FR-018). |

## Identity and comparison

- **Identity kind** — *value*. A domain label has no identity of its own; it is
  compared componentwise as an exact string.
- **Key** — the label itself. Matching is exact. Spellings are not normalized
  aliases, and a hyphenated and an underscored spelling are different labels.
- **Key order** — lexicographic over the label, for collection comparison only.
  It carries no precedence, preference or causal meaning between domains.
- **Absence** — a digest supplied without a selected domain has an absent
  domain. An absent domain compares only to absence; it is never defaulted to
  `raw-artifact-digest` or to any other member.
- **Causal order** — not applicable. A domain label participates in no causal
  structure.
- **Digest domain** — not applicable to the label itself. This artifact *is* the
  vocabulary of digest domains; it does not carry one.
- **Cross-domain rule** — two identities bearing different domain labels are
  unequal. Byte equality of their digests does not make them equal, and a raw
  `sha256` digest cannot substitute for `sha256-jcs` (FR-018-AC-2).

The `sha256-jcs:` textual prefix is a domain label outside the hashed bytes. It
is not a hash preimage prefix (FR-018).

## Preimage selection is per-use, not per-domain

Three requirements independently state what is inside the preimage under the
`quire.verification.jcs` domain, and no requirement cross-references the others:

- [FR-018](../../functional/foundation/FR-018-select-verification-jcs-domain.md): for B's
  automated-report profile the qualified input is the validated automated core
  alone; the external disposition and outer report wrapper are excluded.
- [FR-061](../../functional/protocol/FR-061-report-orthogonal-results.md): the enclosing
  artifact reference carries the digest over the complete canonical result
  bytes, and the digest is not a self-referential field inside those bytes.
- [FR-062](../../functional/protocol/FR-062-project-results-to-portable-verification.md):
  the derived result identity is taken over a distinct projection-identity
  preimage under `quire.protocol.e02-projection-identity/v1-draft.1`.

This artifact records all three. It does not reconcile them; the selection of a
preimage belongs to the requirement that selects it.

## Acceptance Criteria

| ID | Criteria | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FR-201-AC-1 | Each member's value equals the exact label string in the table, and an underscored spelling does not match a hyphenated one. | Inspection |
| FR-201-AC-2 | Two identities with equal digest bytes and different domain labels compare unequal. | Analysis |
| FR-201-AC-3 | A digest with an absent domain compares only to absence and receives no default member. | Analysis |
| FR-201-AC-4 | A lock-file digest does not satisfy a comparison expecting a package fingerprint. | Analysis |

## Dependencies

- [FR-015](../../functional/foundation/FR-015-preserve-canonical-domains.md) establishes the
  distinct domains and the substitution prohibitions.
- [FR-018](../../functional/foundation/FR-018-select-verification-jcs-domain.md) establishes
  the verification JCS selection, output syntax and prefix rule.
- [FR-200](FR-200-quire-assessment-domain.md) supplies the identity discipline.

## Resolved domain boundary

`filament-fingerprint` is a producer-owned identifier over its historical
preimage. `package-fingerprint` is a Quire package identifier. They are separate
domains and never compare equal, even when digest bytes match. A selected exact
Filament export additionally uses `filament.export/v1`; no one of these three
may substitute for another.

## Status

Accepted complete-V1 identity-domain contract. Implementation and qualification
remain tracked separately.
