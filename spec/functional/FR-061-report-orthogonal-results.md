## Description

When any protocol assessment is requested, the result producer SHALL retain separate execution, truth, activation, participation, completeness, adequacy, claim and provenance facts for the exact requested subject.

## Inputs

An exact assessment request plus conformance or analysis observations, prerequisite
outcomes, limitations and derived artifacts.

## Outputs

A portable per-request result consumed by the composed-language dispatcher,
temporal/observation integrations and Engineering Assurance, or a typed strict-
reader refusal if the result is inconsistent.

## Behavior

The result producer SHALL NOT attach a successful truth value to a refused,
unsupported, failed or resource-incomplete execution. The result producer SHALL
NOT classify an inactive obligation as satisfied or demonstrated. If required
participants, observations, population members, progress or adverse cases are
missing, then the result producer SHALL NOT change an unsuccessful or unknown
truth, adequacy or package status to successful. The result producer SHALL retain
proven, bounded-checked, tested and observed claim strengths as distinct
source-bound values. The result producer SHALL reuse Quoin evidence authority.
The result producer SHALL NOT create a local evidence store or verification-method
registry.

## Acceptance Criteria

| ID | Criteria | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FR-061-AC-1 | Healthy, violating, inactive, pending, incomplete, refused, unsupported and failed cases remain discriminable without diagnostic prose. | Test (TC-061) |
| FR-061-AC-2 | Removing a trigger, required role, provider observation, population member or negative case cannot improve truth, adequacy or package-level status. | Test (TC-061) |
| FR-061-AC-3 | Every result binds exact source/profile/model/protocol/request/binding/input/progress/backend identities and derived artifact digests. | Test (TC-061) |
| FR-061-AC-4 | A result with an impossible dimension combination, stale identity or conflicting claim strength is refused by a strict reader. | Test (TC-061) |
| FR-061-AC-5 | One unsupported request does not remove an independent supported result, while package complete success remains unavailable. | Test (TC-061) |
