# TC-195: Model normalization provenance

## Description

Normalize inherited/redefined declarations and mutate identity, digest and rule-order inputs.

## Test Procedure

Use the exact version-locked subject and inputs named by FR-150. Execute its positive case, each declared boundary, and each explicit refusal/non-conclusive mutation through the real local Rust boundary; compare the complete typed result and artifact accounting with the criterion.

## Expected Results

Every positive and boundary result matches FR-150; each invalid, unsupported or exhausted mutation returns its exact typed disposition with source/provenance, emits no approximation, and preserves independent sibling results.
